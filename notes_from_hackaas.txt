#hackaas ideas: 

cosmocalc as an updated webpage (from the widget)
 - which online versions of a cosmocalc exist?

    Ned Wright's page
    kempner.net
    icosmos.co.uk

 - what are the features that they provide?
 - what new data can it include?

astroquery updates
 - new databases
 - port to IDL?
 - make nedpy work properly

Zooniverse twitter - does it automatically update from all our child feeds? Who controls?

Twitter - correlate hashtags/keywords as function of time. Can be done for specific group of users? Would really like party vs. hangover vs. coffee vs. hackaas vs. aas221
